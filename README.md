## Project Overview

The End-to-End Chatbot is designed to help users interact with a machine-learning-driven conversational agent. This chatbot is built using NLP techniques to understand user intent and generate appropriate responses, making it a suitable solution for applications such as customer service, virtual assistance, and FAQ handling.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Detects intent and extracts entities from user messages.
- **Response Generation**: Provides meaningful responses based on recognized patterns.
- **Model Training**: Trains on a labeled dataset to improve accuracy and performance.
- **Customizable**: Adaptable for different industries or applications with minimal changes.
